title: Hello World.

I created this blog to serve as a forcing function to keep me up to date on the latest research in economics and computation. The plan is to read recent papers from relevant conferences (e.g., EC, WWW, AAAI, AAMAS, NIPS) and journals and discuss them here, ideally getting feedback from authors and other domain experts when needed. My hope is that the process of explaining others’ work gives me a better understanding of their research, and that documenting it here will allow me to more quickly recall technical details months down the road.

A second-order goal of this blog is to improve my speed at consuming, digesting, and explaining technical content. I may occasionally have a post about techniques I’ve found helpful. I will try to force myself to follow the “done is better than perfect” mantra and iterate on posts as needed. This will probably increase the number of errors and misunderstandings in my posts, so if you see an issue, please let me know!

Here are some useful links I followed for setting up this blog:
