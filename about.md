I created this blog to serve as a forcing function to keep me up to date on the latest research in economics and computation. The plan is to read recent papers from relevant conferences (e.g., EC, WWW, AAAI, AAMAS, NIPS) and journals and discuss them here, ideally getting feedback from the authors when needed to clarify any sources of confusion. My hope is that the process of explaining others' work gives me a better understanding of their research, and that documenting it here will allow me to more quickly recall more of the paper details months down the road. 


### About me 

I am a research scientist on the Core Data Science team at Facebook. I'm interested in problems at the intersection of game theory / mechanism design and artificial intelligence.
